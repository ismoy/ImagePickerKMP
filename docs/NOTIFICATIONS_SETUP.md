# Discord Notifications Setup Guide

This guide explains how to configure Discord notifications for the ImagePickerKMP CI/CD pipeline.

## Overview

The project includes Discord notifications for:

1. **Basic Notifications** - Integrated directly in the CI workflow
2. **Advanced Notifications** - Separate workflow with detailed coverage information

## Discord Setup

### 1. Create Discord Webhook

1. Go to your Discord server
2. Select the channel where you want notifications
3. Click the gear icon ‚Üí "Integrations"
4. Click "Create Webhook"
5. Give it a name (e.g., "ImagePickerKMP CI")
6. Copy the webhook URL

### 2. Add GitHub Secret

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
5. Value: Paste your Discord webhook URL

## Notification Types

### Basic Notifications (CI Workflow)

These are triggered on every build:

- **Success**: üéâ Build completed successfully
- **Failure**: ‚ùå Build failed

### Advanced Notifications (Notifications Workflow)

These provide detailed information:

- **Build Status**: Success/failure with detailed metrics
- **Coverage Reports**: Line and branch coverage percentages
- **Coverage Alerts**: Threshold-based alerts for low coverage

## Message Format

### Discord Messages

```
üéâ ImagePickerKMP Build Success

Repository: ismoy/ImagePickerKMP
Branch: main
Commit: abc123...
Triggered by: username

üìä Coverage Report:
‚Ä¢ Line Coverage: 45.2%
‚Ä¢ Branch Coverage: 32.1%

Duration: 120s
Workflow: CI

üîó View Details: https://github.com/...
```

## Coverage Thresholds

The system includes automatic coverage alerts:

- **< 20%**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Low coverage warning
- **20-50%**: üìà Coverage improving
- **‚â• 50%**: üéâ Excellent coverage

## Customization

### Modify Notification Channel

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/notifications.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Notify Discord on Success
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL }}
  with:
    args: |
      Your custom message here...
```

### Add Custom Messages

You can customize the notification text by modifying the `args` field:

```yaml
args: |
  üöÄ **Custom Build Success Message**
  
  **Project:** ImagePickerKMP
  **Status:** ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}
  
  Your custom message here...
```

### Disable Notifications

To disable notifications temporarily, comment out the notification steps in the workflow files.

## Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Working

1. **Check Secret**: Ensure `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly
2. **Verify Webhook URL**: Test webhook manually using curl or Postman
3. **Check Channel Permissions**: Ensure the webhook has access to the channel
4. **Review Workflow Logs**: Check GitHub Actions logs for error messages

### Test Webhook Manually

```bash
# Test Discord webhook
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"content":"Test notification from ImagePickerKMP"}' \
  YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### Common Issues

1. **Invalid Webhook URL**: Double-check the URL format
2. **Channel Not Found**: Ensure the channel exists and the webhook has access
3. **Rate Limiting**: Discord has rate limits; notifications may be delayed
4. **Workflow Permissions**: Ensure the workflow has permission to send notifications

## Security Considerations

- **Webhook URLs are sensitive**: Never commit them to the repository
- **Use repository secrets**: Always store webhook URLs in GitHub secrets
- **Monitor usage**: Regularly check webhook usage to ensure it's working as expected

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Channels

You can send notifications to multiple channels by creating multiple webhooks:

```yaml
- name: Notify Discord - Development
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_DEV_WEBHOOK_URL }}
  # ... other config

- name: Notify Discord - Production
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  env:
    DISCORD_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_PROD_WEBHOOK_URL }}
  # ... other config
```

### Conditional Notifications

Send notifications only for specific conditions:

```yaml
- name: Notify on Main Branch Only
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: Ilshidur/action-discord@master
  # ... notification config
```

### Custom Coverage Thresholds

Modify the coverage alert thresholds in `.github/workflows/notifications.yml`:

```yaml
${{ steps.coverage.outputs.line_coverage < 30 && '‚ö†Ô∏è **Low Coverage Alert!**' || '' }}
```
